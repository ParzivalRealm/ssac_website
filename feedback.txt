🔧 GSAP ANIMATION TECHNIQUES:
Professional Animation Patterns:
javascript// Enterprise-grade timeline management
const masterTimeline = gsap.timeline({
  defaults: { ease: "power2.out", duration: 0.8 }
});

// Sophisticated service card reveals
const revealServices = () => {
  return gsap.timeline()
    .from(".service-grid", { scale: 0.9, opacity: 0 })
    .from(".service-card", { 
      y: 60, 
      opacity: 0, 
      stagger: 0.15,
      ease: "back.out(1.7)"
    }, "-=0.4")
    .from(".service-icon", {
      scale: 0,
      rotation: 180,
      stagger: 0.1
    }, "-=0.6");
};

// Mouse-following electric particles
const createElectricTrail = (x, y) => {
  const particle = document.createElement('div');
  particle.className = 'electric-particle';
  gsap.set(particle, { x, y, scale: 0 });
  
  gsap.timeline()
    .to(particle, { scale: 1, duration: 0.3 })
    .to(particle, { 
      scale: 0, 
      opacity: 0, 
      duration: 0.5,
      ease: "power2.out"
    })
    .call(() => particle.remove());
};
ScrollTrigger Advanced Patterns:
javascript// Apple-style equipment assembly animation
ScrollTrigger.create({
  trigger: ".equipment-showcase",
  start: "top 80%",
  end: "bottom 20%",
  scrub: 1,
  onUpdate: (self) => {
    const progress = self.progress;
    updateEquipmentAssembly(progress);
    updateParticleIntensity(progress * 100);
  }
});

// Section-based animation orchestration
ScrollTrigger.batch(".animate-on-scroll", {
  onEnter: (elements) => {
    gsap.from(elements, {
      y: 100,
      opacity: 0,
      duration: 1,
      stagger: 0.15,
      ease: "power3.out"
    });
  }
});
⚡ MOUSE INTERACTION SYSTEM:
Electric Grid Implementation:
javascript// Canvas-based electric grid system
class ElectricGrid {
  constructor(canvas) {
    this.canvas = canvas;
    this.ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    this.nodes = this.generateNodes();
    this.mouse = { x: 0, y: 0 };
    this.init();
  }
  
  generateNodes() {
    const nodes = [];
    const spacing = 50;
    for(let x = 0; x < window.innerWidth; x += spacing) {
      for(let y = 0; y < window.innerHeight; y += spacing) {
        nodes.push({
          x, y,
          active: false,
          intensity: 0
        });
      }
    }
    return nodes;
  }
  
  updateMouse(x, y) {
    this.mouse = { x, y };
    this.nodes.forEach(node => {
      const distance = Math.hypot(node.x - x, node.y - y);
      node.intensity = Math.max(0, 1 - distance / 150);
      node.active = distance < 100;
    });
  }
  
  animate() {
    this.ctx.clearRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height);
    this.drawConnections();
    this.drawNodes();
    requestAnimationFrame(() => this.animate());
  }
}
📱 RESPONSIVE ANIMATION STRATEGY:
Device-Specific Optimizations:

Desktop: Full animation suite with 3D effects and particle systems
Tablet: Reduced particle count, simplified 3D interactions
Mobile: Essential animations only, touch-optimized interactions
Low-power mode: Static fallbacks with CSS-only micro-interactions

Performance Budgets:

Desktop: Max 3 simultaneous GSAP timelines
Mobile: Max 1 active animation, 30fps target
Particle limits: 200 desktop, 50 mobile
Canvas elements: 2 max, with intelligent pooling

♿ ACCESSIBILITY IMPLEMENTATION:
WCAG 2.1 Compliance:
javascript// Respect user motion preferences
const prefersReducedMotion = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');

if (prefersReducedMotion.matches) {
  // Provide static alternatives
  gsap.set("*", { animation: "none" });
  // Show static equipment images instead of assembly animation
  showStaticEquipment();
} else {
  // Enable full animation suite
  initializeAnimations();
}

// User control toggle
const animationToggle = document.getElementById('animation-toggle');
animationToggle.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
  if (e.target.checked) {
    enableAnimations();
  } else {
    disableAnimations();
  }
});
🚀 FINAL OBJECTIVES:
